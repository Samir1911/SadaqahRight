            <h1>Gaza/Palestine Appeal</h1>
            <p>Gaza is described by many Palestinians and humanitarian actors as the <b>world’s largest open-air prison</b>, where <b>1.94
            million</b> Palestinians live behind a blockade and are refused access to the other occupied Palestinian areas and the rest
            of the world.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More than <b>50 years of occupation</b> and 10 years of blockade have made the lives of 1,9 million Palestinians living inside
                the Gaza Strip unbearable. That is why they now are protesting and risking their lives.</li>
                <li>During the first eight months of 2021, Israeli authorities demolished <b>666</b> Palestinian homes and other structures in the
                West Bank, including East Jerusalem, displacing 958 people, a 38 percent increase compared to the same period in 2020,
                according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (<b>OCHA</b>).</li>
                <li>During the May hostilities, 260 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children, and 2,200 were wounded, “some of whom
                may suffer a long-term disability requiring rehabilitation,” according to OCHA</li>
                <li>The fighting also damaged <b>331 educational</b> facilities, 10 hospitals, and <b>23</b> primary health clinics.</li>
                <li>Authorities in Gaza said that <b>2,400</b> housing units were made uninhabitable and over 50,000 units were damaged. 8,250 people remained internally displaced as of October 14, OCHA said.</li>
                <li><b>Half of all children</b> have been psychologically traumatised by war, occupation and blockade. Close to 300,000 children need psychosocial help.</li>
            </ul>
