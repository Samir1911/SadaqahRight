            <h1>Rohingya Crises</h1>
            <p>The exodus began on 25 August 2017 after Rohingya Arsa militants launched deadly attacks on more than 30 police posts.Rohingyas arriving in Bangladesh said they fled after troops, backed by local Buddhist mobs, responded by burning their villages and attacking and killing civilians.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>By the end of August 2021, Bangladesh was hosting more than <b>890,000</b> Rohingya refugees in the Cox’s Bazar District,around half of whom were children. Those fleeing attacks and violence in the 2017 exodus joined around <b>300,000</b> people already in Bangladesh from previous waves of displacement, effectively forming the world’s largest refugee camp.</li>
                <li>At least <b>6,700</b> Rohingya, including at least 730 children under the age of five, were killed in the month after the violence broke out, according to <b>medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Amnesty International</b> says the Myanmar military also raped and abused Rohingya women and girls.</li>
                <li>The government, which puts the number of dead at 400, claims that "clearance operations" against the militants ended on 5 September, but BBC correspondents have seen evidence that they continued after that date.</li>
                <li>At least <b>288</b> villages were partially or totally destroyed by fire in northern Rakhine state after August 2017, according to analysis of satellite imagery by <b>Human Rights Watch</b>.</li>
            </ul>
