            <h1>Afghanistan Crises</h1>
            <p>Almost <b>10 million</b> people are living on the brink of famine, a figure that will rise unless help is provided. That means
            more than half of the population are expected to battle hunger in 2022. Many of these families have already endured
            decades of hardship and conflict, having to sell property and even loved ones into arranged marriages just to survive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Afghans have suffered more than 40 years of conflict, natural disasters, chronic poverty, food insecurity and most
                recently the COVID-19 pandemic. Violence in Afghanistan is worsening in intensity and spreading in reach – causing even
                more human suffering and displacement. Their resilience and the resilience of their host communities is being stretched
                to the absolute limit.</li>
                <li>Today, nearly <b>6 million</b> Afghans have been driven out of their homes and their country by conflict, violence and poverty.</li>
                <li>“Afghanistan’s displacement crisis is one of the largest and most protracted in <b>UNHCR’s</b> seven-decade history. We’re now
                seeing a third generation of Afghan children born in exile,’’ says UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.
                </li>
