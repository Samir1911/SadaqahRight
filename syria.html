            <p>In 2021, a third of children in Syria showed signs of psychological distress including anxiety, sadness, fatigue, or
                frequent trouble sleeping.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Almost 13,000 children have been killed and injured since the beginning of the conflict.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, a severe economic crisis, mass displacement, a widely devastated public service infrastructure and
                    the
                    COVID-19 pandemic have left more than 14.6 million people requiring humanitarian assistance, including 6.5
                    million children.</li>
                <li>Out of 20.5 million people in Syria, more than half of the population are in dire need of health assistance.
                </li>
                <li>For many children in Syria, war is the only thing they know. They continue to live in fear of violence,
                    landmines, and
                    explosive remnants of war. They struggle with physical and psychological scars of war.</li>
            </ul>
